        “The majority of my interactions with police were not good. There were a
        few good ones who were actually protecting the community. 
<br><br>
        But then you
        have ones from the Valley. They never met me in their life, but since
        I’m a kid in basketball shorts and a white T-shirt, they wanna slam me
        on the hood of the car.

        Sixteen years old. Temptation is just the feeling that you’re the most independent person on planet Earth. 
<br><br>
        That you know everything. That’s something that we all go through as a kid.
        Now, this lifestyle that I’m in, the same thing exists! But it’s 10
        times worse because everything is at my disposal. 
<br><br>
        When you’re in the limelight, you can get anything you want.”
